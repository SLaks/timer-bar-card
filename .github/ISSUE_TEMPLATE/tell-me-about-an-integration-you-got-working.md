Thank you for taking the time to document your card configuration! Feel free to simply delete this text and describe the integration you set up and changes you made to get the card working. However, using the structure below and filling in all the sections will help me add the changes faster.

**Integration name and link**

**Your card configuration**
```yaml
type: custom:timer-bar-card
...
```

**Caveats**
Any bugs?
